# tlsio

## Overview

This specification defines generic behavior for tlsio adapters, which operate primarily through the `xio` 
interface and provide communication to remote systems over a TLS-conformant secure channel.

The following types from `xio.h` are also referenced in individual requirements.

    IO_OPEN_ERROR,
    IO_OPEN_CANCELLED
} IO_OPEN_RESULT;

**SRS_TLSIO_30_003: [** Tlsio adapter implementations shall define and observe the internally defined `TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` timeout value for opening, closing, and sending processes:
  ```c
// This value is considered an emergency limit rather than a useful tuning parameter,
// so it is not adjustable via the more expensive get / set options system
#ifndef TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
#define TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS 40
#endif // !TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
  ```
**]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_004: [** Tlsio implementations which use an internal buffer to pass data into the `on_bytes_received` callback shall define the size of this buffer with the internally defined `TLSIO_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE` value.
  ```c
// The TLSIO_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE has very little effect on performance, and is kept small
// to minimize memory consumption.
#ifndef TLSIO_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE
#define TLSIO_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE 64
#endif // !TLSIO_RECEIVE_BUFFER_SIZE
  ```
**]**

## External State
The external state of the tlsio adapter is determined by which of the adapter's interface functions have been called and which callbacks have been performed. The adapter's internal state should map cleanly to its external state, but the mapping is not necessarily 1:1. The external states are defined as follows:

* TLSIO_STATE_EXT_CLOSED means either that the module is newly constructed by `tlsio_create`, or that the `tlsio_close` complete callback has been received from a `tlsio_close` call.
* TLSIO_STATE_EXT_OPENING means that the `tlsio_open` call has completed successfully but the `on_tlsio_open_complete` callback has not been performed.
* TLSIO_STATE_EXT_OPEN means that the `on_tlsio_open_complete` callback has returned with `IO_OPEN_OK`.
* TLSIO_STATE_EXT_CLOSING means that the `tlsio_close` call has completed successfully but the `on_tlsio_close_complete` callback has not been performed.
* TLSIO_STATE_EXT_ERROR is the state entered (or maintained) after either of the following occurrences:
  * `on_tlsio_open_complete` has been called with `IO_OPEN_ERROR`
  * `on_ tlsio _error` has been called

## State Transitions
This list shows the effect of the calls as a function of state with happy internal functionality. Unhappy functionality is not shown because it always ends in TLSIO_STATE_EXT_ERROR. The `tlsio_setoption` and `tlsio_getoptions` calls are not shown because they have no effect on state and are always allowed. Calls to `tlsio_send` also do not affect state, but are allowed only during TLSIO_STATE_EXT_OPEN.

## Design Decisions

This section describes design decisions and their rationale. These decisions are not themselves part of the specifications, 
but the individual specifications will conform to these decisions.

**Retry policy**: the tlsio adapter shall not initiate error recovery of any sort.<br/>
**Reason for retry decision**: Decisions such as how, when, and whether to retry after error are high level policy 
decisions that are deliberately deferred to the higher level modules that own the tilso adapter. The tlsio adapter 
is not competent to make any guesses about what the correct retry behavior should be.

**Unsent messages policy**: the tlsio adapter shall discard any unsent messages when it receives a “close” command.<br/>
**Reasons for unsent messages decision**:
  1. This is consistent with existing tlsio adapters.<br/>
  2. Decisions about which messages should be re-sent after a (possibly lengthy) recovery must be deferred to higher level modules. Discarding all unsent messages upon `tlsio_close` puts that responsibility where it belongs.

**No fake sends policy**: although it would be possible to enqueue messages no matter what state the tlsio is in, the 
tlsio shall only accept messages for transmission when it is in the TLSIO_STATE_OPEN state.<br/>
**Reasons for no fake sends decision**:
  1. This is consistent with existing tlsio adapters.
  2. Accepting messages in other states amounts to poorly designed message queuing, and message queuing is already implemented properly at higher levels.
  3. Accepting messages in other states would require non-trivial design and unit test work and force the redesign of higher levels without adding any real functionality.

**Redundant callback during `tlsio_open`**: If `tlsio_open` fails, the tlsio adapter shall call the supplied `on_io_open_complete` 
callback. This implies that the adapter must enter the TLSIO_STATE_ERROR state rather than remaining in TLSIO_STATE_CLOSED, 
which would be more natural.<br/>
**Reason for redundant callback**: The reason for callbacks in the first place is because asynchronous operations cannot 
always provide all necessary feedback in their return values. In the case of a failed "begin operation" such as tlsio_open, 
the failure return already contains all of the useful information, making the callback redundant. In a greenfield design, 
simplicity would dictate that the callback not be made, but existing tlsio adapters already make this redundant callback, 
so new tlsio adpaters must conform to this behavior.

**Usage error policy**: If the caller commits usage errors, the tlsio adapter shall log the error and return failure, 
but shall not alter its internal state. Usage errors include:
* `tlsio_open`, `tlsio_send`, or `tlsio_close` are called during TLSIO_STATE_EXT_OPENING (invalid usage)
* `tlsio_open` is called during TLSIO_STATE_EXT_OPEN (invalid usage)
* `tlsio_open`, `tlsio_send`, or `tlsio_close` are called during TLSIO_STATE_EXT_CLOSING (invalid usage)
* `tlsio_open` or `tlsio_send` are called during TLSIO_STATE_EXT_ERROR (invalid usage)

**Reasons for usage error policy**:
* The behavior of existing tlsio adapters is not consistent in this regard. For example, tlsio_arduino does change state on usage errors but tlsio_open_ssl, tlsio_mbedtls, tlsio_schannel, and tlsio_wolfssl do not. Fortunately the upper-level modules that use tlsio adapters do not perform improper usage, so they don't depend on improper usage acting in any particular way.
* The tlsio adapter must handle and announce usage errors sensibly. But it is not possible to anticipate whether entering TLSIO_STATE_EXT_ERROR would aid the troubleshooting process or impede it, so the tlsio adapter shall favor design simplicity rather than getting its internal knickers in a knot by changing state when usage errors occur.

**Failed `tlsio_send` calls policy**: If the `tlsio_send` operation fails, the tlsio adapter shall log an error, return failure, and call the message's callback appropriately, but the adapter shall not change its internal state.<br/>**Reason for failed `tlsio_send` policy**: Tlsio adapters conforming to this spec enqueue incoming messages rather than sending them directly, so the only possible errors are usage errors and out-of-memory errors. Neither of these situations calls for the tlsio adapter to change its state, so it won't.

**Mandatory callbacks policy**: All of the callback functions in the tlsio adapter API are mandatory.<br/>
**Reasons for mandatory callbacks policy**: 
* Tlsio adapters are designed for asynchronous operation, and correct usage of the adapter is difficult or impossible without using all of the callbacks.
* The higher-level SDK modules that use tlsio already provide the callback functions.
* Allowing optional callback functions would significantly increase the number of required unit tests.
* The cost to the caller of providing callback functions is trivial.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_057: [** When the closing process is complete, `tlsio_close`  shall call `on_io_close_complete` and pass the `callback_context` as a parameter. **]**


###   tlsio_send
Implementation of `IO_SEND concrete_io_send`
```c
int tlsio_send(CONCRETE_IO_HANDLE tlsio_handle, const void* buffer, size_t size, ON_SEND_COMPLETE on_send_complete, void* callback_context);
```

**SRS_TLSIO_30_060: [** If the `tlsio_handle` parameter is NULL, `tlsio_send` shall log an error and return _FAILURE_. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_065: [** If `tlsio_open` has not been called or the opening process has not been completed, `tlsio_send` shall log an error and return _FAILURE_. **]**

###   tlsio_dowork
Implementation of `IO_DOWORK concrete_io_dowork`
```c
void tlsio_dowork(CONCRETE_IO_HANDLE tlsio_handle);
```
The `tlsio_dowork` call executes async jobs for the tlsio. This includes connection completion, sending to the SSL connection, and checking the SSL connection for available bytes to read.

The underlying OpenSSL `SSL_read` call does not return errors if the connection has been lost, so the tlsio will not know if the connection has been lost until it attempts a write operation.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_070: [** If the `tlsio_handle` parameter is NULL, `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing except log an error. **]**

#### Post-error behavior

These post-error behavior specifications take precedence over all other behavior specifications.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_071: [** If the `tlsio` adapter has returned a failure from `tlsio_open` or if `on_io_open_complete` has been called with `IO_OPEN_ERROR` or `IO_OPEN_CANCELLED`, then `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_072: [** If `tlsio_dowork` ever calls `on_io_error`, then subsequent calls to `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing. **]**

#### Behavior selection

**SRS_TLSIO_30_075: [** If `tlsio_dowork` is called before `tlsio_open`, `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_076: [** If `tlsio_dowork` is called after `tlsio_close`, `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_077: [** If  `tlsio_dowork` called after `tlsio_open` but before the connection process completes, `tlsio_dowork` shall perform the [Connection completion behaviors](#connection-completion-behaviors) but not the [Data transmission behaviors](#data-transmission-behaviors) or the [Data reception behaviors](#data-reception-behaviors). **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_078: [** If `tlsio_dowork` is called after the connection process completes successfully, `tlsio_dowork` shall perform the [Data transmission behaviors](#data-transmission-behaviors) and then the [Data reception behaviors](#data-reception-behaviors) but not the [Connection completion behaviors](#connection-completion-behaviors). **]**

#### Connection completion behaviors

Connection completion may require multiple calls to `tlsio_dowork`. The number of calls required is not specified.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_080: [** The `tlsio_dowork` shall establish an OpenSSL connection using the `hostName` and `port` provided during `tlsio_open`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_081: [** If the connection process takes longer than the internally defined `TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` it shall log an error and call `on_io_open_complete` with the `on_io_open_complete_context` parameter provided in `tlsio_open` and `IO_OPEN_ERROR`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_082: [** If the connection process fails for any reason, `tlsio_dowork` shall log an error and call `on_io_open_complete` with the `on_io_open_complete_context` parameter provided in `tlsio_open` and `IO_OPEN_ERROR`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_083: [** If `tlsio_dowork` successfully opens the ssl connection it shall call `on_io_open_complete` with the `on_io_open_complete_context` parameter provided in `tlsio_open` and `IO_OPEN_OK`. **]**

#### Data transmission behaviors

**SRS_TLSIO_30_090: [** If an enqueued message size is 0, the `tlsio_dowork` shall just call the `on_send_complete` with the `callback_context` and `IO_SEND_OK`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_091: [** If `tlsio_dowork` is able to send all the bytes in an enqueued message, it shall call the messages's `on_send_complete` along with its associated `callback_context` and `IO_SEND_OK`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_092: [** If the send process for any given message takes longer than the internally defined `TLSIO_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` it call the message's `on_send_complete` along with its associated `callback_context` and `IO_SEND_ERROR`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_093: [** If the OpenSSL send was not able to send an entire enqueued message at once, subsequent calls to `tlsio_dowork` shall repeat OpenSSL send for the remaining bytes. **]**

/// DELETE ME ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
**SRS_TLSIO_30_094: [** If the send process encounters an internal error or calls `on_send_complete` with `IO_SEND_ERROR` due to either failure or timeout, it shall also call `on_io_error` and pass in the associated `on_io_error_context`. **]**
/// DELETE ME //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**SRS_TLSIO_30_095: [** If the send process fails before sending all of the bytes in an enqueued message, the `tlsio_dowork` shall call the message's `on_send_complete` along with its associated `callback_context` and `IO_SEND_ERROR`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_096: [** If there are no enqueued messages available, `tlsio_dowork` shall do nothing. **]**

#### Data reception behaviors

The underlying API for OpenSSL is not capable of detecting useful errors when attempting to receive, so it will never call the `on_io_error` callback supplied during `tlsio_open`.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_100: [** If the OpenSSL client is able to provide received data, the `tlsio_dowork` shall read this data and call `on_bytes_received` with the pointer to the buffer containing the data, the number of bytes received, and the  `on_bytes_received_context`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_102: [** If the OpenSSL client gets no data from its `SSL_recv` call then it shall not call the  `on_bytes_received` callback. **]**


###   tlsio_setoption
Implementation of `IO_SETOPTION concrete_io_setoption`
```c
int tlsio_setoption(CONCRETE_IO_HANDLE tlsio_handle, const char* optionName, const void* value);
```

###   tlsio_retrieveoptions
Implementation of `IO_RETRIEVEOPTIONS concrete_io_retrieveoptions`
```c
OPTIONHANDLER_HANDLE tlsio_retrieveoptions(CONCRETE_IO_HANDLE tlsio_handle);
```

**SRS_TLSIO_30_161: [** The `tlsio_retrieveoptions` shall do nothing and return NULL. **]**

### Error Recovery Testing
The state transition behavior described earlier in this document fully specifies how the tlsio adapter should behave under 
every possible call sequence, and it implies a set of unit tests which are extensive but not provably complete. This section specifies
some additional unit tests which would capture failures which have been seen during retry sequences.

The test conditions in this section are deliberately underspecified and left to the judgement of the implementer, and code commenting
in the unit tests themselves will be considered suffucient documentation for any further detail. Any of a number of possible
specific call sequences is acceptable as long as the unit test meets the criteria of the test requirement. 

The word "retry" as used in the specs in this section means that:
  1. A failure has been injected at some specified point
  2. `tlsio_close` has been called and the `on_io_close_complete` callback has been received.
  3. `tlsio_open` has been called successfully.
  4. `tlsio_dowork` has been called as necessary to permit this sequence of events.
  5. The `on_io_open_complete` callback has been received with `IO_OPEN_OK`.

Note that the requirements in this section have corresponding entries in the unit test files, but do not
appear in the implementation code.

**SRS_TLSIO_30_200: [** The tlsio adapter shall successfully retry after an injected fault which causes 
`on_io_open_complete` to return with `IO_OPEN_ERROR`. **]**

**SRS_TLSIO_30_201: [** The tlsio adapter shall successfully retry after an injected fault which causes 
 `on_io_error` to be called. **]**
